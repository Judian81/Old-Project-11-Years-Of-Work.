# Old-Project-11-Years-Of-Work.

this project is made in vb6 and directx7. they are both not any longer supported.
but maby there is some code in this project were you can learn about.

you can not compile this code in the ways i know. directx was so changed it broke when .net was introduced.

![directx user interface](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46109964/142715895-473eb078-3ce4-4fa2-8611-b9fc36903308.jpeg)


i made a email client that could only get attachment but could not read html. so you just see text.
also an address book was one of the many things i created. i could call from my adres book.
see there star signs. i even had a moment i could see my project while i was gaming in call of duty.
so on that way i could change the album what i wanted to play.

all settings and databases the applications used could be seen by opening 1 program.
it was fun doing it and i have learnd a lot of it.


most of the things i had deleted in the past. so there are no applications anymore. and this is just the simple user interface.
